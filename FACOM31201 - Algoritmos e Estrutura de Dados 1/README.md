<h3>Algoritmos e Estrutura de Dados 1</h3>
Programming exercises assigned by my Data Structures and Algorithms I teacher during the second semester of my Computer Science degree, implemented in C. These programs include implementations of linked lists, static lists, stacks and queues.
In the major project (Trabalho de conclus√£o da disciplina) i've learned how to use Git and how to document the major changes in commits.
